## Directory listings for zsh with git features

**k** is a zsh script / plugin to make directory listings more readable, adding a bit of color and some git status information on files and directories.

### Git status on entire repos

### Git status on files within a working tree

### File weight colours
Files sizes are graded from green for small (< 1k), to red for huge (> 1mb).

It Would really like to make this posix compliant so that it can be used with bash and other shells. But don't really know anything about shell scripting, so if you think you could help that would be cooool :)
